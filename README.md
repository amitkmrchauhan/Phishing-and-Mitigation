<h1>PyPhisher Unveiled - Crafting Deceptive Links, Masking Tactics, and Mitigation Strategies for Targeted Exploitation</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Phishing, a pervasive cyber threat, drove me to create this project. Recognizing its widespread impact and the imperative for effective defense strategies, I focused on combating it. The choice of phishing as the project's focal point stems from its prevalence and the urgent need for countermeasures. Leveraging the PyPhisher tool, I demonstrate how attackers craft deceptive emails and links to exploit unsuspecting users. This Python-based framework empowers me to simulate attacks and test defenses comprehensively. Through advanced techniques like deceptive link crafting and masking, I showcase the sophistication of phishing tactics. In conclusion, I shared mitigation strategies aimed at enhancing cybersecurity resilience and protecting against phishing attacks, emphasizing the importance of proactive measures for staying safe online.
